// Being in a room, either as the host running it or as a member who joined it. Members connect
// straight to the host, which sends everyone the room whenever it changes and applies what each
// member does. When the host leaves or is lost, the member who has been in the room longest takes
// over and the others reconnect to them through the room's code. Matches and spectating connect
// separately.
